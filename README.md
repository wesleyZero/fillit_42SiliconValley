# 'Fillit' a Tetris-like game in C. 

## 42 Silicon Valley
This project was done at a free coding school called '42 Silicon Valley', which was unfortunately shut down permanently after the 2020 pandemic. It originally started in france, this is the [french '42' school's website](https://42.fr/en/homepage/). The US 42 schools website was shutdown but their [old instagram](https://www.instagram.com/42siliconvalley/?hl=en) is still up if you are curious what the school was about.

#### How did this coding school work?
At 42 you were not allowed to use almost any libraries whatsoever. You had to build everything from scratch. 42 had no in-person instructors, it was a self taught school.

## Project Description 

[PDF Instructions](https://github.com/wesleyZero/fillit_42SiliconValley/blob/main/fillit.pdf), [Logic Flow Chart](https://github.com/wesleyZero/fillit_42SiliconValley/blob/main/42SV_fillit/Fillit_FLOWCHART.pdf), and [Header File](https://github.com/wesleyZero/fillit_42SiliconValley/blob/main/42SV_fillit/fillit.h) to see all of the functions neccessary for the program. The main function is located in the [fillit.c](https://github.com/wesleyZero/fillit_42SiliconValley/blob/main/42SV_fillit/fillit.c) file. 

### Overview 
The program is based off the idea of 'Tetris' where you are given a set of 'tetriminos'.
